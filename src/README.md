Given the complexity of the application, we will need to create several classes, functions, and methods. Here is a high-level overview:

1. `Business` class: Represents a business in the system. Contains properties such as `Id`, `Name`, `Email`, `RewardScheme`.
2. `Customer` class: Represents a customer in the system. Contains properties such as `Id`, `Username`, `Email`, `Businesses`.
3. `RewardScheme` class: Represents a reward scheme defined by a business. Contains properties such as `Id`, `BusinessId`, `RewardDescription`, `StampsRequired`.
4. `Stamp` class: Represents a stamp that a customer can earn. Contains properties such as `Id`, `CustomerId`, `BusinessId`, `TimeStamp`.
5. `BusinessController` class: Contains methods for handling HTTP requests related to businesses.
6. `CustomerController` class: Contains methods for handling HTTP requests related to customers.
7. `QRCodeService` class: Contains methods for generating and decoding QR codes.
8. `AuthenticationService` class: Contains methods for handling authentication and authorization using Azure AD B2C.
9. `DatabaseContext` class: Represents the database context for Entity Framework Core.
10. `Startup` class: Contains methods for configuring the application.

Now, let's start with the entry point of the application, the `Program.cs` file:
